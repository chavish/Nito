Thou art some fool, I am loath to beat thee.
Thine face is not worth sunburning.
Thy food is such as hath been belch'd upon by infected lungs.
I throw thy name against the bruising stones.
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death.
I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables.
Thou art essentially a natural coward without instinct.
You are as a candle, the better burnt out.
Get thee to a nunnery.
Thy bones are hollow; impiety has mad a feast of thee.
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
Your face is as a book, where men may read strange matters.
Sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal!
Drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Thou art a wretch whose natural gifts were poor.
I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
Thou art as fat as butter.
Thou art open to incontinency
Thou art wither'd like an old apple-john.
